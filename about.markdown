### More Information

I'm a software developer, consultant, and teacher. My passions center around catalyzing teams through continuous
improvement, explicit transparent communication, and ruthless attention to quality.

Pivotal Labs is my current home where work in the Pivotal Onsite Delivery organization as a Software Development Advisor
(I'm still hands-on). I travel frequently and change context often.
